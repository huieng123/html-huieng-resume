<h2>Cooking/Eating</h2>

<p>I love eating as much as the next person, but I also like to try new recipes here and there</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>Some of my book recommendations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What you are looking for is in this library, Michiko Aoyama - A very wholesome book that shows you how many different lives and their perspectives.</li>
    <li>Daughter of the Moon Goddess, Sue Lynn Tan - You will love this if you like fantasy,or Chinese Historical dramas</li>
    <li>Pachinko, Min Jin Lee - Looks at the struggles through generations, I think this is very relatable as a first gen immigrant</li>
</ul>

<p>Look for me on GoodReads: Hui Eng Lim</p>
